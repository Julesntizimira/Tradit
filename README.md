#  ~ *Swap Books - Share the fun*

# Introduction

## The Project
Tradit will address the common scenario where individuals accumulate books they no longer need. Often, after reading a book, one might prefer not to keep it unless they are building a personal library. Tradit will offer a platform to exchange, or give away these books, creating an opportunity to connect with others interested in these titles.

## The Context
This project serves as my Portfolio Project, marking the conclusion of my Foundation at ALX - Holberton School. I had the option of working either in a team or doing it solo. While I desired to undertake this project collaboratively and reap the benefits of teamwork, I ultimately chose to work alone due to my availability constraints during these days. I didn't want to be a burden to anyone.

## The Team
I am a passionate coder who enjoys bringing a creative touch to projects. Here's a bit about me:

[Jules Ntizimira](https://twitter.com/NtizimiraJ) - Book lover and entrepreneur, currently working solo on this project. I bring a unique perspective to coding, fueled by a passion for both literature and entrepreneurship.

## User Stories

As a book enthusiast
I want to discover a platform for exchanging books
So that I can exchange my read books for new ones without incurring additional costs**

### Acceptance Criteria:
- As a user, I should be able to create a profile on the platform.
- I should be able to browse through a diverse range of available books.
- I want to search for specific books by title, author, or genre.
- Upon finding a book of interest, I should be able to view details such as book author, genre and user reviews.
- I need the option to propose a book exchange by offering one of my owned books.
- I want to be notified when someone expresses interest in one of my books for an exchange.
- Upon confirmation, I should be provided with a secure channel for communication with the other party to finalise the exchange details.


## Blog posts
After the development phase, i wrote a blog post to reflect on the tradit journey.

# Architecture

## Overview
web app consists of Python and MySQL on the backend, Flask as the framework interface, and HTML/CSS and Javascript for frontend functionalities. Nginx manage the server side and served by gunicorn application server. Beside i created another app for Api, Both apps are running on different ports. for some functionalities the main app access the server directly but for others it uses api

the app provide realtime live chat between users, to facilitate communication, if a user like the book he can chat with the owner
